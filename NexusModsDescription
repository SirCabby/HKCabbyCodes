[b]Posting for help[/b]
[list]
[*]Please include this log info if you can get it when posting about it not working
[/list]
Lumafly Users:
[list=1]
[*]There should be a log created at `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight\ModLog.txt` - send me those contents.
[*]Include your operating system
[/list]
BepInEx Users:
[list=1]
[*][b]BepInEx console logs[/b]: You should see a secondary window show up for BepInEx (outside the game window, may need to play in windowed mode to see it). If it exists, copy the logs out.
[*]If it exists, copy the contents of "Hollow Knight\BepInEx\LogOutput.log"
[*]Include your operating system
[/list]
[b]Menu is not showing or Game Crash[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Lumafly[/b]: Is the ModLog.txt available?
[/list][list=1]
[*]Find the log mentioned in the section above and send it my way!
[/list][list]
[*][b]BepInEx[/b]: Is BepInEx console running?
[/list][list=1]
[*]If not, there's something wrong with your BepInEx installation. Either you grabbed the wrong version for your operating system (I put the default in for Windows, which is the only OS I can officially support), or perhaps not all the files were placed in the right spots. Double check the folder paths labeled above. BepInEx is not supported by me, and you can find further troubleshooting info on their [url=https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/troubleshooting.html]site[/url]. Unfortunately if you cannot get BepInEx to run, it has nothing to do with this mod and I won't be much help other than the directions I've given.
[*]If it is running, grab the info explained in the posting for help section and post it, I'll take a look.
