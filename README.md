### 🔧 Development Requirements

#### .NET Framework and SDK
- **Target Framework**: .NET Framework 4.7.2 (required for compatibility with nuget dependencies and BepInEx version 6)
- **SDK Version**: .NET 9.0.301 (latest available, .NET 5.0+ is compatible)
- **Language Version**: C# 7.3 (latest supported by .NET Framework 4.7.2)

#### Required Tools
- **Visual Studio 2019/2022** or **Visual Studio Code** with C# extension
- **.NET 9.0 SDK** (for building with latest tooling)
- **Git** for version control

#### Configuration Files
- **global.json**: Specifies SDK version 9.0.301
- **CabbyCodes.csproj**: Targets `net472` with `LangVersion` set to `7.3`
- **CabbyMenu.csproj**: Targets `net472` with `LangVersion` set to `7.3`

### 📚 Required Library Files

Before building the project, you need to obtain the following DLL files and place them in the `CabbyCodes/lib/` directory:

#### Required Files:
- **Assembly-CSharp.dll** - Main game assembly (from Hollow Knight installation)
- **PlayMaker.dll** - PlayMaker FSM library (from Hollow Knight installation)

#### Optional Files:
- **UnityExplorer.STANDALONE.Mono.dll** - UnityExplorer in-game inspector (from UnityExplorer release) *(optional, see note below)*

#### File Structure:
```
CabbyCodes/
└── lib/
    ├── Assembly-CSharp.dll
    ├── PlayMaker.dll
    ├── UnityExplorer.STANDALONE.Mono.dll
```

**Note**: These files are excluded from version control due to licensing restrictions. You must obtain them manually before building and debugging the project.

#### UnityExplorer - In-Game Debug Tool

**What is UnityExplorer?**
UnityExplorer is a powerful in-game inspector and debugger that provides a graphical interface for examining game objects, components, and values at runtime. It's essential for development and debugging of Hollow Knight mods.

**What does it do?**
- **Object Inspector**: Browse and examine all game objects in the scene
- **Component Viewer**: View and modify component properties in real-time
- **Value Editor**: Change game values on-the-fly for testing
- **Method Invoker**: Call game methods directly for debugging
- **Scene Browser**: Navigate through different game scenes and objects

**How to Install UnityExplorer:**
1. **Download**: Get the latest release from [UnityExplorer GitHub](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer/releases)
2. **Extract**: Download the `UnityExplorer.STANDALONE.Mono.dll` file
3. **Install**: Place the DLL in your Hollow Knight `BepInEx/plugins/` folder
4. **Activate**: The mod automatically creates a UnityExplorer instance when the game starts

**Using UnityExplorer:**
- **Access**: Press `F7` in-game to open the UnityExplorer window
- **Debugging**: Use it to inspect game state, player data, and scene objects
- **Development**: Essential for understanding game structure and testing mod features

- If you want to use UnityExplorer, you can comment out the following line in `CabbyCodes/CabbyCodesPlugin.cs` (inside the `Start` method):
  ```csharp
  UnityExplorer.ExplorerStandalone.CreateInstance();
  ```
- This will allow you to build and run the mod with `UnityExplorer.STANDALONE.Mono.dll` in your `lib` folder.

#### UniverseLib - Reflection and Debugging Library

**What is UniverseLib?**
UniverseLib is a powerful reflection and debugging library that provides advanced tools for accessing private fields, methods, and game objects at runtime. It's commonly used in Hollow Knight modding for deep game state inspection and manipulation.

**What does it do?**
- **Reflection Utilities**: Access private fields and methods
- **Object Inspection**: Deep examination of game objects and components
- **Memory Manipulation**: Advanced memory reading and writing capabilities
- **Runtime Type Creation**: Create and modify types at runtime
- **Debugging Tools**: Enhanced debugging and development features

**How to Install UniverseLib:**
1. **Download**: Get the latest release from [UniverseLib releases](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UniverseLib/releases)
2. **Extract**: Download the `UniverseLib.Mono.dll` file
3. **Install**: Place the DLL in your Hollow Knight `BepInEx/plugins/` folder
4. **Usage**: Access through UnityExplorer or other modding tools

**Using UniverseLib:**
- **Integration**: Works with UnityExplorer for enhanced debugging
- **Development**: Essential for advanced mod development and testing
- **Reflection**: Access game internals that aren't normally accessible
